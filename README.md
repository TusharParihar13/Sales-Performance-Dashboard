# Sales-Performance-Dashboard
Sales Performance Dashboard built in Excel using pivot tables and slicers to analyze product, regional, and customer segment sales trends.

**About the Project**

This project is an end-to-end Sales Performance Dashboard built in Microsoft Excel.
The goal was to turn raw retail sales data into something meaningful that business users can actually use to understand **where sales are coming** from and **what’s driving performance**.

Everything in this project follows how Excel is used in real companies — from data cleaning to pivot tables to interactive dashboards.

**Business Problem**

The business had sales data, but no clear way to answer questions like:

-> Which product categories generate the most sales?

-> Which regions are performing better than others?

-> Which products contribute the most revenue?

-> Which customer segment drives overall sales?

This dashboard was created to give **quick, visual answers** to those questions.

**What This Dashboard Shows**

The Sales Performance Dashboard focuses on four main areas:

-> **Sales by Category and Sub-Category**
    Helps identify which product lines are driving revenue.

-> **Top 10 Products by Sales**
    Highlights best-selling products and revenue concentration.

-> **Sales by Region**
    Compares regional performance to spot strong and weak markets.

-> **Customer Segment Contribution**
    Shows how much each customer segment contributes to total sales.
    All visuals are fully interactive using slicers.

**Dataset**

The dataset contains order-level retail sales data, including:

-> Order dates

The data was cleaned and standardized before analysis, and all dashboards are built using a single **cleaned data table** as the source of truth.

-> Technology products contribute the highest share of sales

-> A small number of top products generate a large portion of revenue

-> The West region consistently outperforms other regions

-> The Consumer segment contributes the majority of sales

**Why This Project Matters**

This project demonstrates how Excel can be used not just for calculations, but for **real business analysis and decision-making**.
It reflects the kind of dashboards used by sales managers and leadership teams to track performance and plan strategy.
